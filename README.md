# signal-esp8266-python
Signal Protocol Implementation for ESP8266 in Python

I have utilized nacl and libsignal libraries of python. Considering embedded devices in mind, I have modified the libsignal library wherever possible and have made it a bit simpler in structure.

It is an outcome of my Dissertion project of M.Tech. Please let me know in case you want to modify the library, w.r.t any optimizations required as per low power embedded systems and security features.
